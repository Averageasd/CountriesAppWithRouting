# Countries App With Routing

## About
App that matches incoming requests with defined routes using
UseRouting. If /country or /country/{id} is supplied, we execute
the matching routes. Otherwise, we execute the fallback route.

## What I learnt?
I learnt how to map incoming requests to appropriate api endpoints and the priority
of these endpoints.
